Download the dataset from Kaggle from the following link https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/rsna-bone-age

The downloaded dataset should contain the following
-- boneage-training-dataset folder (training images should be directly under this folder)
-- boneage-test-dataset folder (test images should be directly under this folder)
-- boneage-training-dataset.csv (This contains image id and target)
-- boneage-test-dataset.csv

For running individual codes

Place the following files and folders in the same location

-- boneage-training-dataset folder (This should contain training images)
-- boneage-test-dataset folder (This should conatin test images)
-- boneage-training-dataset.csv (This contains image id and target)
-- boneage-test-dataset.csv
-- mywork.py

Run mywork.py

For Running Final code present under the Code folder

Place the following files and folders in the same location

-- boneage-training-dataset folder (This contains training images)
-- boneage-test-dataset folder (This conatin  test images)
-- boneage-training-dataset.csv (This contains image id and target)
-- boneage-test-dataset.csv
-- MLP_Custom_CNN.py
-- Xception.py

Run MLP_Custom_CNN.py which contains MLP and CNN models 
Run Xception.py which contain pretrained model
